OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the world created by volunteers. It plays a crucial role in various fields, including urban planning, disaster management, and navigation. Our community in Kerala has been actively contributing to OSM by mapping local areas, improving data accuracy, and organizing community events.

The meetup aims to bring together OSM enthusiasts from Kerala to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and strengthen our community. We plan to conduct workshops, presentations, and discussions on various aspects of OSM, including mapping techniques, data analysis, and community building.

Your financial support will help us cover the expenses of the meetup, including:

Venue rental
Refreshments and meals
Printing and stationery
Travel expenses for speakers and participants (if necessary)
We believe that your contribution will make a significant impact on the growth and development of the OSM community in Kerala. By supporting our meetup, you will be empowering local citizens to create and contribute to a free and open map of their region.

We have attached a detailed budget for your reference. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or require further information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,



Naveen Francis
